# Blockchain Game Software Development Kit (BGSDK): Foundation

Heathen Engineering's BGSDK Foundation allows you to manage in-game items as blockchain assets. It is a complete wrapper around [Arkane Network](https://arkane.network/)'s Web API. The tool simplifies integration with Arkane API exposing all features and functions to C# classes and includes Editor extensions to aid in design and deployment of Contracts and Tokens.

## Requirements
Please note that you will need to register for an account with [Arkane Network](https://arkane.network/) to recieve the required Client ID and Secret used by the kit to connect to the [Arkane Network](https://arkane.network/) backend. This must be aquired from [Arkane Network](https://arkane.network/) directly.
